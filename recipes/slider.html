    <h3>Slider</h3>
    <p>Sliders are foods that are very easy to eat and are often foods that bariatric patients turn to for a number of reasons. They are easy to eat - the sometimes uncomfortable feelings of tightness that follows when a patient is full doesn’t occur as often with softer foods.</p>

    <h3>Slider Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>onion diced</li>
        <li>cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Dinner rolls</li>
        <li>Melted butter</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C)</li>
        <li>Combine the beef, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) rimmed baking dish, mixing thoroughly, then pressing into a flat, even layer. Bake for 20 minutes. Drain the liquid and set the cooked beef aside.</li>
        <li>Slice the rolls in half horizontally. Place the bottom half in the same baking dish. Place the cooked beef on top of the bottom rolls, followed by the onions, cheese, and the top rolls.</li>
        <li>Brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter and sprinkle the sesame seeds on top. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Slice into individual sliders, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
